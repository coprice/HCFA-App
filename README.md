# HCFA-App

### Description

The HCFA-App serves as a medium for organizing the activities of Harvard College Faith and Action (HCFA), a student-led Christian organization at Harvard College. The app has three main features: events, bible courses, and ministry teams. Admins and leaders can create, update, and delete events, while all users can browse upcoming and past events and add them to their calendar if they wish. Admins can create and edit bible courses, while all users can browse bible courses and request to join courses. Once joined in a course, a user can add that course to their calendar, see the other members of the course, as well as have access to the course's groupme. Admins can create and edit ministry teams, while all users can browse ministry teams and request to join them. Once joined in a ministry team, a user can add weekly meetings to their calendar, have access to the team groupme, and see other members of the team.
